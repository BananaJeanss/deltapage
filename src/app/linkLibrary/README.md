# Library of Links

For contributors:
If you wish to add a new link to the library of links, doing so should be simple.

The added link should be UT/DR related of course, and should not have any typos.

The following format is used for any entries:

```json
{
    "category": "Deltarune",
    "title": "Deltarune Wiki",
    "description": "The official Deltarune Wiki."
    "link": "https://deltarune.wiki/"
}
```
