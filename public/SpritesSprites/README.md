# Sprites

For obvious reasons I will not be putting the 50k sprites deltarune has in this repo

## Exporting/Getting the sprites

1. Download https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool
2. Open the chapter's data.win via undertalemodtool
3. In the top bar, Scripts > Resource Exporters > ExportAllSprites.csx
4. No padding, Yes for subfolders
5. Copy the subfolders into the Chapter[.] folders ofc

## Uploading to blob

1. Make sure you have the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` set in .env
2. Run `node organizer.js` and wait
3. Profit
