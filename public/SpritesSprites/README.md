# Sprites

For obvious reasons I will not be putting the 50k sprites deltarune has in this repo

## Exporting/Getting the sprites

1. Download https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool
2. Open the chapter's data.win via undertalemodtool
3. In the top bar, Scripts > Resource Exporters > ExportAllSprites.csx
4. No padding, Yes for subfolders
5. Copy the subfolders into the Chapter[.] folders ofc

## Organizing the subfolders

This is a bit messy, and the organizer.js does the bare minimum, but it's better than nothing.

1. Run `node organizer.js`
2. Profit
